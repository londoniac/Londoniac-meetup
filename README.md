# Londoniac meetup
Organising and managing a meetup is much easier when you involve the community.

You know what you'd like to hear about and we'd like to hear your ideas about what should be in the next meetup!

Join the [LondonIAC meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/londoniac/ "LondonIAC Meetup") here for updates about future meetups.
